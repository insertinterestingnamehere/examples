This repository is a collection of small self-contained code examples that
demonstrate various design patterns, principles, package features, or
mathematical methods.

When working through ways to do something in code, I often find myself testing
the functionality I need using small self-contained examples before trying to
apply new techniques to larger problems. These simple examples usally also serve
as a reference for various tricks I've learned after extensive trial and error.

I'm uploading some of my examples here so that I can more easily share them in
discussions with other developers and so that they can benefit others who happen
to be trying to do some of the same things.

The examples here are not bug-free and are not set up to work across all
platforms or configurations. As a general rule, however, each example is small
enough that it should be easy for someone familiar with their development
environment to adapt them so that they will work in the needed contexts.
Regardless of what the example is intended to do, don't expect it to work
properly or even at all. This is a stash of ideas and examples, not a collection
of cros-platform machine-independent idioms. Some things may not work at all.
Outside contributions are still welcome to fix bugs or add examples that serve a
purpose similar to the others already present here.
